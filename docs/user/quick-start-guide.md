## Common First-Time Questions 🤔

**Q: Why don't I see any people?**
A: Check if you're looking at a time when people are typically present. Try selecting "Today" if you chose a past date.

**Q: The colored boxes keep changing colors - why?**
A: Each person gets a unique color ID. The system tracks them across cameras and maintains the same color.

**Q: What do the numbers mean?**
A: Numbers are unique person IDs. The same number on different cameras means it's the same person.

**Q: Why do some boxes disappear and reappear?**
A: This is normal - detection can be affected by lighting, occlusion, or camera angles.
